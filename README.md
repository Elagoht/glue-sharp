This is a C# clone of glue commandline tool. Glue is a commandline tool to paste files.
There's a paste command for it but it cannot align texts. Glue does that. Now, I remake
it in C# with OOP. The original tool was written in Python.

## Examples

try this commands and check file contents to understand working logic.

```sh
glue-sharp header.csv data.csv -d ";" -s " | "
   Full Name    |        Job         |          Email           |       Languages       
Furkan Baytekin | Software Developer | furkanbaytekin@gmail.com | Python, JavaScript, C#
```

```sh
glue-sharp header.txt data.txt -s " | "
   Full Name    |        Job         |          Email           |       Languages

```
